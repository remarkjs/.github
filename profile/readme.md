# [![remark][logo]][monorepo]

[**remark**][monorepo] is a popular free and open source tool that transforms
markdown with plugins.
These plugins can inspect and change your markup.

#### Markdown

Markdown is a markup language that often feels more natural to type than HTML.
It typically looks more like whatâ€™s intended and is terser.

*   we follow [CommonMark][] by default (GFM with [`remark-gfm`][remark-gfm],
    MDX with [`remark-mdx`][remark-mdx])
*   to learn markdown, see this [cheatsheet and tutorial][cheat]

#### Quick links

*   we use [`micromark`][micromark] for parsing and [mdast][] as the syntax tree
*   to find plugins, see [`awesome-remark`][awesome], the
    [list of plugins][plugins], and the [`remark-plugin` topic][topic]
*   for more about us, see [`unifiedjs.com`][site]
*   for updates, see [Twitter][]
