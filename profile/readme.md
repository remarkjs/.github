# [![remark][githubusercontent-logo]][github-remark]

**[remark][github-remark]** is a popular free and open source tool that
transforms markdown with plugins.
Markdown is a markup language that often feels more natural to type than HTML.
Plugins can inspect and change markdown.

* to learn markdown, see this [cheatsheet and tutorial][commonmark-help]
* we follow [CommonMark][] by default
  (GFM with [`remark-gfm`][github-remark-gfm],
  MDX with [`remark-mdx`][github-remark-mdx])
* we use [`micromark`][github-micromark] for parsing and
  [mdast][github-mdast] as the syntax tree
* to find plugins, see [`remarkjs/awesome-remark`][github-remark-awesome],
  the [list of plugins][github-remark-plugins],
  and the [`remark-plugin` topic][github-topics-remark-plugin]
