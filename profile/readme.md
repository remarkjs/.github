# [![remark][logo]][monorepo]

[**remark**][monorepo] is a popular free and open source tool that transforms
markdown with plugins.
Markdown is a markup language that often feels more natural to type than HTML.
Plugins can inspect and change markdown.

*   to learn markdown, see this [cheatsheet and tutorial][cheat]
*   we follow [CommonMark][] by default (GFM with [`remark-gfm`][remark-gfm],
    MDX with [`remark-mdx`][remark-mdx])
*   we use [`micromark`][micromark] for parsing and [mdast][] as the syntax tree
*   to find plugins, see [`awesome-remark`][awesome], the
    [list of plugins][plugins], and the [`remark-plugin` topic][topic]
