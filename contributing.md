## Contributions

Thereâ€™s several ways to contribute, not just by writing code.
If you have questions, see [support][].

### Financial support

Itâ€™s possible to support us financially by becoming a backer or sponsor through
[Open Collective][collective].

### Improve docs

As a user youâ€™re perfect for helping us improve our docs.
Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, new examples, etcetera.

### Improve issues

Some issues lack information, arenâ€™t reproducible, or are just incorrect.
You can help by trying to make them easier to resolve.
Existing issues might benefit from your unique experience or opinions.

### Write code

Code contributions are very welcome.
Itâ€™s probably a good idea to first post a question or open an issue to report a
bug or suggest a new feature before creating a pull request.

## Submitting an issue

*   The issue tracker is for issues.
    Use discussions for support
*   Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new
    issue
*   Ensure youâ€™re using the latest version of our packages
*   Use a clear and descriptive title
*   Include as much information as possible: steps to reproduce the issue,
    error message, version, operating system, etcetera
*   The more time you put into an issue, the better we will be able to help you
*   The best issue report is a [failing test][unit-test] proving it

## Submitting a pull request

*   Run `npm test` locally to build, format, and test your changes
*   Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent
    you from doing unnecessary work
*   For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the
    community for feedback as soon as possible
*   New features should be accompanied by tests and documentation
*   Donâ€™t include unrelated changes
*   Test before submitting code by running `npm test`
*   Write a convincing description of why we should land your pull request:
    itâ€™s your job to convince us
